# Speech Recognition

This is program uses Convolutional Neural Networks, spectrograms, and various image processing techniques to create a software package that can create and recognize words from an "audio dictionary"

[Data used for this model](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)

The current accuracy (based on an unseen data set) tends to be around 95% for the .py implementation

## Add:
* discretize the training and implementation of the neural net
* implement in tensorflowRT/TFLite in order to process continuous speech
